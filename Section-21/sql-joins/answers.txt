1. Join the two tables so that every column and record appears, regardless of if there is not an owner_id. 
SELECT * FROM owners o FULL JOIN vehicles v ON o.id = v.owner_id;

2. Count the number of cars for each owner. Display the owners first_name, last_name and count of vehicles. The first_name should be ordered in ascending order.
SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) AS count FROM owners o JOIN vehicles v ON o.id = v.owner_id GROUP BY first_name, last_name ORDER BY count;

3. Count the number of cars for each owner and display the average price for each of the cars as integers.
SELECT first_name, last_name, ROUND(AVG(price)) AS average_price, COUNT(*)
FROM owners o JOIN vehicles v ON o.id = v.owner_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 AND ROUND(AVG(price)) > 10000
ORDER BY first_name DESC;


Question for Mesut:
Is there a particular reason that I cannot use aliases in my HAVING statement?
